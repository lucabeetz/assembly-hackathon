Sinking into despair once more, I was glancing around the classroom when I was startled by the sight of a certain girl. She had big almond-shaped eyes that tilted up at the corners ever so slightly and crimson lips like flower petals. She was very pretty, but not in a typical way. How could I describe it?

We sat in our seats feeling sullen and miserable, like girls who had been passed over, rejected, for lacking some fundamental quality, until the old math teacher, who was also our homeroom teacher, stepped into the classroom. Even Yun Taerim, with her crimson lips and almond eyes, wasn\u2019t exactly immune.

Not simply because she was Hae-on\u2019s sister, but because the two sisters could not have been more different. Hae-on always had a far-off look in her eyes, and she was fair, tall, and slender, with long graceful limbs, while Da-on was short and dumpy, with a plain face. Hae-on was blessed with extraordinary beauty, but her grades were in the mid-low range, whereas Da-on was the freshman rep and had been at the top of her grade.

Yet it was Da-on whose white blouse was frequently stained with ink or food, which amused us to no end. Being a freshman, Da-on\u2019s classes ended early, but she usually waited outside our classroom until we were done and walked home with Hae-on. As for Hae-on, she usually submitted to Da-on, but there were times she tried to lose her younger sister. Then you could witness the older sister fleeing gracefully down the hall or across the school field with her long lithe limbs, while the younger one raced shrieking after her, like some wild animal. This scene never failed to give both teachers and students a good laugh. That was Da-on\u2019s gift. She had a lively, bubbly kind of warmth that could pull Hae-on\u2019s devastating, otherworldly, even glacial, beauty into our reality, dissolving it in laughter.", "URN:ISBN:9781800241503_Text/007.xhtml_24": "I had the opportunity to get to know Da-on separately, through the school\u2019s literary club.

Once students entered their senior year, they could be exempted from extracurricular activities, but she encouraged me to continue with the club, as long as my involvement didn\u2019t interfere with my studies. To make my time worthwhile, she offered to pick poems and stories that appeared frequently on college entrance exams for the club readings and discussions.

Though it was true that around six p.m. on June 30 he\u2019d taken Hae-on for a ride in his new car\u2014or his sister\u2019s brand-new car, to be more precise\u2014he\u2019d dropped her off at seven and gone to a high-end Japanese restaurant with friends, who were also the sons of wealthy families. They watched the final World Cup match between Brazil and Germany over dinner and expensive liquor, and then around ten headed to a hotel nightclub famous for attracting pretty girls. He danced and drank all night, making a last stop at the restaurant across the street to have some hangover soup before finally proceeding home. Everyone backed Jeongjun\u2019s story: his friends who had been with him, the server at the Japanese restaurant, the nightclub waiter, as well as the owner of the hangover soup restaurant. Soon after the incident, Jeongjun was fined for driving without a license and suspended from school for entering an adult entertainment venue as a minor, but even when his suspension ended, he didn\u2019t return to school. They said he\u2019d been withdrawn well before he received his suspension, and was sent to study abroad in America. Then what had been the point of suspending someone who was no longer there? This question, however, failed to become an important issue.", "URN:ISBN:9781800241503_Text/007.xhtml_32": "The next-strongest suspect after Shin Jeongjun was Han Manu. Several details from the statement Manu had given about seeing Kim Hae-on in the passenger seat of Shin Jeongjun\u2019s car were extremely suspicious and altogether lacked credibility. Some said he\u2019d committed perjury because he was stupid, while others claimed that the shrewd detective had been able to pick out the discrepancies in Manu\u2019s carefully crafted story, and still others said Yun Taerim\u2019s statement had completely overturned Manu\u2019s statement.

Though she stated that she\u2019d heard her brother come home in her sleep, the police didn\u2019t accept her testimony.", "URN:ISBN:9781800241503_Text/007.xhtml_34": "Manu was beaten for refusing to admit to the crime, and threatened and pressured to make a confession. In the end, he was released, since no clear evidence or motive for the murder could be found. But even after his release, detectives continued to show up at his door to question his mother and sister. The students picked sides as to who the real perpetrator was: Shin Jeongjun or Han Manu. At a glance, it seemed more students believed that Han Manu was guilty, probably because the students in this group were generally confident and had no qualms about voicing their opinions. Those who believed that Shin Jeongjun was guilty tended to be cautious and timid. Perhaps because of this, most students were swayed to believe in Jeongjun\u2019s innocence.", "URN:ISBN:9781800241503_Text/007.xhtml_35": "Han Manu didn\u2019t return to school after the summer break.

Then naturally someone would laugh or yell. But unlike before, when laughter and shouts would spread, they withered abruptly. The instant the noise was cut off, an oppressive hush hung heavily over the classroom. We were all seized by the same guilt, and the classroom was as still as the inside of a vacuum.

There were times when I\u2019d been confronted by that void, that invisible presence, and been thrown into confusion. I\u2019m sure the other students have experienced it, too. Gradually, we managed to return to our rightful place, our emotions numbed by the strain and struggle of our looming college entrance exam. We told ourselves: Some of us had to go, that\u2019s all. One had an accident, one went abroad, one transferred schools, one dropped out, but we\u2019re still here, aren\u2019t we? Ah, this is killing us. Nothing\u2019s changed. What kind of life is this?

No, she\u2019d taken a year off in senior high. I could only nod. Of course I understood. Who could keep attending school as if everything were the same?

I sipped my coffee in silence. Da-on had her back turned to the boys, sitting rigidly like some yellow crustacean, as if she were determined not to listen to anything they said. Her plastic surgery made her look like her sister, but something was off.

From the moment she was born, he did a total one-eighty. It was to the point \u2026 Ah, it makes me think of that day, the day he was putting her to sleep. Okay, I\u2019ll try to explain. Yebin was an extremely fussy baby. If she hadn\u2019t been so beautiful, I probably would have lost it and given her a spanking. She was a terrible sleeper, too. She wouldn\u2019t fall asleep unless you held her, and even then, you had to rock her for a long time before she\u2019d finally fall asleep. But that day, he held her for a long time, rocking her to sleep. I had no idea he could be so patient \u2026 You see, he has a bit of a temper and he\u2019s not the type to bend over backward for anyone.

And then \u2026 and then \u2026 he started crying. Quietly, without making a sound. Why did he cry? I\u2019d never seen him cry before. I\u2019d known him since high school\u2014though I didn\u2019t see him when he went to America for school, obviously\u2014but he wasn\u2019t one to cry.

That\u2019s the only thought I had. Why? I don\u2019t know. All I know is that I wanted to die. Because I was depressed. I was so depressed I wanted to die.

At least once. In other words, never again. Da-on was avoiding me. Not just me, but anyone who knew about the incident from long ago. As she should. She would want to be cut off from the rest of the world, to be forgotten. Is that why she had gained weight, put on glasses, and concealed herself in a large parka the color of eggplant, as if she meant to hide herself in a cocoon? In case someone might recognize her?", "URN:ISBN:9781800241503_Text/012.xhtml_104": "As I got off the subway, I told myself that all these thoughts might be ridiculous, baseless speculations. But if they weren\u2019t, if my hunch turned out to be true, what had happened in the summer of the Korea-Japan World Cup wasn\u2019t over. And it never will be. It will go on endlessly, until the end of Da-on\u2019s life, or maybe beyond that. Not being able to put an end to an incident so horrific\u2014I couldn\u2019t begin to imagine that kind of weight on a life."}, {"URN:ISBN:9781800241503_Text/013.xhtml_1": "FOR A long time, I didn\u2019t have the nerve to go inside the laundry plant where Han Manu worked. I\u2019d gone there many times, but I\u2019d been so terrified by the deafening drone that I\u2019d had to turn around.", "URN:ISBN:9781800241503_Text/013.xhtml_2": "That day, when I finally worked up the courage to step through the open door of the facility, the air inside was hot and muggy. Laundry bins hit the ground with a boom and linens cracked as they were pulled taut. I stepped farther inside, thinking I could bear the noises. Then I heard a bell clashing, a knife being sharpened, objects stabbed again and again by an awl, gasps and shrieks\u2014they entered my ears and became amplified, swelling before my eyes until I couldn\u2019t take another step forward.", "URN:ISBN:9781800241503_Text/013.xhtml_3": "As I was about to turn to leave, I caught sight of Han Manu between the garments moving on the overhead conveyor belt. The moment I saw his long, tranquil face, a small miracle occurred. The terrible noises died down. No, it would be more correct to say the nature of the noises changed. What had been like the screeching of metal on metal converged, ballooning like a giant cloud, until it gradually deflated. Each noise assumed its original sound, becoming ordinary once more. I heard the whir of the washers, the rattling of the dryers, the beeping of timers, and the whoosh of the steam iron. No longer were they the roars that had tried to attack and beat me, but sounds restored to their proper shapes, like tools organized neatly in a tool box. I listened, like someone hearing these sounds for the first time. That\u2019s right, you\u2019re supposed to hear them, not see them, I chanted calmly to myself. Still, it was truly noisy inside the facility.", "URN:ISBN:9781800241503_Text/013.xhtml_4": "I stepped into the narrow aisle. I passed by old men sorting the dirty laundry and checking their contamination level, old women in rubber gloves who were scrubbing the soiled spots with detergent, and middle-aged women swiftly putting dress shirts and suit jackets on body forms that went around in a circle. According to Seonu, when Han Manu first started working at the plant, he\u2019d been assigned these simple tasks as well. But now, he was stationed where the dummies made their last stop. The pressing cabinet, shaped like a body form, ironed the front and back of the garment at the same time, then it was removed and placed before Han Manu. Seated in a chair, he spread the garment on the ironing board and delicately pressed the parts that needed to be redone with a hand iron. Just as the chicken shop owner had said, Han Manu was a good worker. He held the iron in his right hand, and with his left hand gently lifted the shirt collar, cuffs, front hem, and interlining as he worked, but his movements were so light and nimble that it was hard to believe what Seonu had said, about his hand and arm being covered with blisters from burn injuries he\u2019d suffered. The iron seemed a natural part of his right arm, or even an extension of it, not something that was hot or dangerous. The clothes that passed through his hands were hung on hangers, covered with plastic, and then carried away on an overhead conveyer belt.", "URN:ISBN:9781800241503_Text/013.xhtml_5": "A short while later, he moved to a different station to press the linens. With a crutch wedged under his left arm, he held, like a rifle, a long steam iron connected to a boiler in his right hand. Once he clipped the sheet to the rack and it became completely spread out, he limped sideways, pushing and pulling the iron in a straight line. The precision of his work was immediately apparent on the sheet. As he shuffled to the side while moving his iron back and forth, the wrinkled sheet that had just come out of the dryer became perfectly smooth. To my eyes, he didn\u2019t appear to be ironing; it seemed he was weaving a brand-new sheet. I watched him work for a long time. His head, now bald from chemotherapy, shone through the steam spewing from the iron, and dazzling new linen sprang from his graceful movements. When he turned and tripped, falling on the bumpy floor of the facility, and even after he died, I saw that scene in my mind, ever so clearly, for a very long time.", "URN:ISBN:9781800241503_Text/013.xhtml_7": "I DIDN\u2019T go to his funeral. It had been a long time since I\u2019d lost touch with Seonu. But there are times I miss the siblings so much I can hardly bear it. I miss the smell of simmering pork bones that had hung in the air of their home, and I even miss their mother, who with her short stubby fingers had marinated the cabbage that would go in the soup. They would still be living in the same place in Suite 301 of Building A, but I can\u2019t set foot in their home, or get my shoes repaired at the small shop in the building in front of their home. Neither can I listen to the singing of hymns drifting out from the church on the second floor. I won\u2019t be able to see Seonu or her mother for a long time. I might never be able to see them again.", "URN:ISBN:9781800241503_Text/013.xhtml_8": "I know better than anyone that they\u2019re good people. But if by any chance Shin Jeongjun and Yun Taerim tell the police about the incident from long ago\u2014I doubt they ever will, but if they decide to come clean\u2014the first thing the police will do is track down Han Manu\u2019s family. And since he has died, they will question his mother and sister, monitoring their every movement. While answering the police\u2019s various questions, they might mention me. In their open, good-natured way, they might describe when I had first come looking for them, how we had set our doubts to rest, how we had grown close since then. Then the police will lock their sights on me.", "URN:ISBN:9781800241503_Text/013.xhtml_9": "I still can\u2019t help but wonder, do our lives truly hold no meaning? Even if you try desperately to find it, to contrive some kind of meaning, is it true that what\u2019s not there isn\u2019t there? Does life leave only misery behind? Could the fact that we\u2019re alive\u2014the fact that we\u2019re in this life where joy and terror and peace and danger mingle\u2014couldn\u2019t that itself be the meaning of life? Hadn\u2019t Han Manu, with an iron in one hand and a crutch wedged under his other arm, been more alive than anyone in this world, more alive than the cancer cells that had spread to his lungs? Hadn\u2019t my sister Hae-on\u2014as she sat with her feet on the sofa or car seat, her knees spread with not a thought in her head, with absolutely no clue as to the inappropriateness of her actions\u2014been warm and exquisitely alive, just like a bird about to take flight? Couldn\u2019t each moment we\u2019re living now be the meaning of life?", "URN:ISBN:9781800241503_Text/013.xhtml_11": "THEY ARE gone now. But through the death of Han Manu, I was able to mourn my sister. I finally understood that her life, just like his, was painfully snuffed out; it wasn\u2019t just her perfect beauty that was snuffed out but her very essence. They died, but I\u2019m alive. To be alive\u2014if this indeed is enough, I won\u2019t think about anything else from now on. I\u2019m still here and each day I carry on. With me are my mother and little Hye-eun, a guilt no one knows about and an abiding loneliness.", "URN:ISBN:9781800241503_Text/013.xhtml_12": "Sometimes I think about the rage that had seethed within me the first time I\u2019d visited Han Manu. I think about the curses I\u2019d heaped on him, how I\u2019d shrieked that his amputated leg meant he was being punished, that his illness wouldn\u2019t stop there. I recall the moment he\u2019d said knees, sitting with his back turned to the small kitchen window. I recall his grinning face. His grin that had smoothed out his pinched face that resembled a pickle, turning it into a bright canary melon instead, his grin I\u2019d looked upon heartlessly while feeling a violent hatred, his naive, foolish grin that had revealed his feelings for a certain girl.", "URN:ISBN:9781800241503_Text/013.xhtml_13": "I picture the scene in my mind. An eighteen-year-old boy waits at the intersection on his delivery scooter. Behind the boy sits a pretty girl with crimson lips and eyes that tilt up at the corners. When the traffic lights change, the scooter comes to life and her hands grasp his sides. Her hands are warm and soft like feathers. She\u2019s wearing a tank top with shorts, she says, her breath grazing his ear. His creased cheeks become flushed with a happiness he\u2019d never once felt in his brief life. Beneath it all, an unknown terror is lurking. He races across the intersection brimming with joy and terror, almost soaring into the radiant June dusk."}, {"URN:ISBN:9781800241503_Text/014.xhtml_1": "KWON YEO-SUN was born in Andong, South Korea, and now lives in Seoul.
